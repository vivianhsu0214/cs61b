FROM his shoulder Hiawatha                      
Took the camera of rosewood                    
Made of sliding folding rosewood               
Neatly put it all together                     
In its case it lay compactly                   
Folded into nearly nothing                     
But he opened out the hinges                   
Pushed and pulled the joints                   
   and hinges                                  
Till it looked all squares                     
   and oblongs                                 
Like a complicated figure                      
in the Second Book of Euclid
